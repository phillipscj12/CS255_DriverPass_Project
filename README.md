# CS255_DriverPass_Project
“Portfolio submission for CS 255 showcasing system analysis and design work for the DriverPass project.”

The DriverPass project involved designing an online system that helps students schedule driving lessons, practice for exams, and track their progress. The kind of system they wanted me to design was a user-friendly solution that made it easier for both students and instructors to communicate and manage scheduling. The system requirements focused on providing clear lesson booking, a feedback mechanism for instructors, and flexible payment options.

When I look back on my work, I feel I did particularly well transforming the client’s goals into detailed user stories. By focusing on what students and instructors actually do, such as booking lessons, sending reminders, and providing feedback, I ended up with a design that felt practical and user-centered. This approach meant I never lost sight of the real-world problems we were trying to solve.

If I could revisit one part of my project documents, I would spend more time refining process flow diagrams to handle unusual scenarios like last-minute cancellations or payment errors. Covering those edge cases in more detail would strengthen the design, ensuring fewer surprises later in development. My method for turning user needs into design choices starts with direct feedback about where students struggle or what kind of functionality instructors expect. Incorporating their input ensures the system focuses on actual pain points rather than assumptions. I believe this is crucial because a system that doesn’t address real user problems might work fine on paper but fail to help anyone in practice.

As far as my overall strategy for software design goes, I love starting with simple diagrams, user stories, and a clear outline of features before diving into coding details. It helps me spot potential issues early on. In the future, I plan to leverage more Agile techniques, like sprint-based work and frequent check-ins, to keep the design aligned with evolving requirements.
